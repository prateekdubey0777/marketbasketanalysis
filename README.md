Market Basket Analysis with Association Rule Mining

Welcome to this project on Market Basket Analysis, where we use Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm) to understand customer purchasing patterns! This technique is widely used in retail to find combinations of items that frequently co-occur in transactions.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

Analyze shopping behavior using association rules
Find frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm
Generate strong rules based on support, confidence, and lift
Visualize the findings using bar plots and heatmaps
Evaluate rule quality with a confusion matrix and accuracy score
It's perfect for those who are learning data mining, machine learning, or just want to build a fun and practical project in Python!

📁 Dataset

We use a simple Market Basket dataset containing transactions of grocery products categorized by aisles (like "energy bars", "prepared soups", etc). Each row represents a product associated with an aisle.

📄 File used: 10. Market Basket Analysis.csv

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

Python 🐍
Pandas
mlxtend
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Google Colab (for running the notebook)
🚀 How It Works

Load the dataset
Preprocess the data into a transactional format
Use the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets
Generate association rules
Visualize:
Top itemsets with a bar chart
Item frequencies with a heatmap
Lift between rules with another heatmap
Evaluate predictions using a confusion matrix and calculate accuracy
📊 Sample Outputs

✅ Strong Rule Example:

If a customer buys prepared soups salads, they are likely to buy specialty cheeses (confidence: 78%, lift: 1.5)
📈 Accuracy Score (based on test rule): ~85%

🖼️ Visuals Included:

Bar Chart of Frequent Itemsets
Item Frequency Heatmap
Lift Heatmap of Rules
Confusion Matrix for a selected rule
📚 Learnings

How association rules work in real life (market basket, recommendations)
Interpreting support, confidence, and lift
Applying machine learning to business data
Visualizing rules for easy understanding
🧠 Future Improvements

Add more detailed transactional data
Apply to real-world datasets (e.g. Instacart, Amazon)
Try other rule mining techniques like FP-Growth
Integrate into a dashboard or e-commerce platform
